Simple library to repeatedly call a member function, free function or lambda at a given time interval.

## Features

* Use various callback types:
  * Class member functions via `std::bind`
  * Free functions
  * Lambdas
* RAII cleanup, don't have to worry about explicitly calling `stop()`.

## Usage

```cpp
#include <periodic_function/periodic_function.hpp>

// call function every 300 milliseconds
dp::periodic_function heartbeat([]() {
    // do something here...
}, 300U);

// start calling function
heartbeat.start();

// optional: stop calling the function
// function will stop being called when object goes out of scope
heartbeat.stop();
```

## Building

Use the following commands to build the project

```bash
cmake -S <source_dir> -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

To run tests, simple `cd` into the build directory and run:

```bash
ctest --build-config Debug
```

### WIP Items

Performance on MacOS is currently not up to my standards. This is actively being investigated.
